BONUS
Read a file with this format:

FUNCTION_NAME
VARIABLETYPE
#end

FileExample:
testing
int
#end

The script must then generate C or C++ code
If we take the example from above:

int testing(int var1)
{
    return (var1)
}

if there's multiple variables, must return the first one. If they all are int, must return the sum of the ints.
If there's multiple function, must write each one of them.
